# Advanced Adaptive Scientific Calculator

An advanced, adaptive scientific calculator built as a Progressive Web App (PWA). This application features a robust calculation engine powered by [math.js](https://mathjs.org/), supports comprehensive keyboard input, maintains a history of calculations, and offers customizable themes, font styles, and button styles.

## Features

- **Adaptive Calculation Engine**  
  Utilize complex mathematical functions including trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), logarithms (`log10`, `ln`), square roots, powers (`^`), factorials, and constants (e.g., Ï€).

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  A clean, modern interface with a dynamic display that shows both the current expression and the computed result.

- **Keyboard & Touch Support**  
  Full keyboard support for quick input along with a clickable button interface optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Calculation History**  
  Automatically save and display up to 20 recent calculations with the ability to quickly reuse previous results.

- **Customizable Themes & Styles**  
  Choose from multiple color themes (Light, Dark, Blue, Green, High Contrast), various font styles (Roboto, Open Sans, Montserrat, Calculator Font), and button style options (Default, Rounded, Square). All settings persist using localStorage.

- **PWA & Offline Functionality**  
  Register a service worker for caching assets and enabling offline use, making this calculator a true Progressive Web App.
